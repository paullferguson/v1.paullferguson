			<div id="portupper"><h2>Project Description</h2>Design and manufacture - was a three member group course spanning a single term and required us to design and manufacture an automated crane......out of Meccano.
			&nbsp;To fulfill the three degrees of freedom criteria we opted for a crane which rolled on a track rather the a traditional design used by most other groups for a bit of variation. When it came to the competition the lifts and drops of 3 blocks were executed perfectly. This earned us second place, which is very respectable considering we were the only group compromising solely of product designers competing against engineers and mech-enge students. </div>
