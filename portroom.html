			<div id="portupper"><h2>Project Description</h2>For our first 3D Studio Max project we were required to recreate four real life photos as best we could. The enviroments were visited and measured to get dimensions and photos taken of textures. The recorded dimensions were then used to build the scenes around and the texture manufactured in Photoshop. Lighting was added a camera to get a render as close to the originals as possible.</div>
