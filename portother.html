One of my greatest passions has always been getting out on my bike weather it was racing on my mountain bike or just commuting on my road bike.
<br\>BMX has always provided me with a wealth of experiences I otherwise would have missed. Through travel and people along the way I have found a lot more than just punctures.
<br\>A little bit of creativity always makes things more interesting even if one's canves is a bike. So I recently "re-painted" my bike from John Deer green and yellow to "Financial Times." </div>
