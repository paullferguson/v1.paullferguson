			<div id="portupper"><h2>Project Description</h2>Main second year project within a group of six of us. The project started with a complete redesign if the interior of the recently launched Airbus A380. As nominated group leader I delegated tasks among the group and oversaw the design and build. The project then focused on the economy seating and covered the complete design process, concluding with a full scale working prototype. The chair featured a multifunctional folding mechanism allowing passenger to sleep and for the chair to be folded up for stowing extra luggage. Flexible branding was another important goal for the team allowing the seat to be sold for advertising. All finished with a cheeky video.</div>
