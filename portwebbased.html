			<div id="portupper"><h2>Project Description</h2>Web Bases design was the name of the course which simply meant the professor responsible was based in the Netherlands. The brief was to select a room or architectural feature and then design a household product of our choice to complement that space. Mediterranean open spaces were my environment and audio streaming my product. References to wind and neutrality were important and so a nautical theme was developed through sails and rigging. The final product was wall mounted and remote operated with LED's lit through the canvas to denote functions. The research, development, final designs and environment renders were then submitted as a web based slide show.</div>
