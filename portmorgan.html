			<div id="portupper"><h2>Project Description</h2>Set with a 48 hour deadline the challenge was to take a design classic of our choice from a previous decade and have a bit of fun redeveloping and updating the product. My choice was the Morgan Roadster, a classic British sport car with some great feature. The main feature for me was to keep the shape and to reinforce the tradition. Ash has always been used for the chassis and so this was incorporated into the rear defuse. Racing wheels were unashamedly added but thankfully the leather bonnet lashes remained.</div>
